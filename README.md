# My Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio. This is the first website I've built without using any source code, and it combines all the techniques I've learned so far with html and css, in order to present all of my best works in one place. Here you will see a little bit about me, some of my favorite projects, and how to get in touch with me. This was not only a project to help me showcase my skills and what I've learned thus far, but also a wondering learning opportunity. There is no better experience then hands on. During my time coding this portfolio, I was given the opportunity to work on many different aspects, such creating a responsive layout, designing a user friendly ui, incorporating multiple different sources, as well as implementing navigation. The following image displays some of the websites functionality.
